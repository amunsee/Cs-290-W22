5 Websites:

1) http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/ - what i dislike about this website is the design of it, granted it wasn't intended to be anything other than a genius cash grab it is absolutely horrible to look at for a viewer. It's a combination of poor layout and cluttered sensory overload. to improve the page I would rearrange the content(the ads) on the page to allow some spacing between them and organize the layout to be easier on the eyes.

2)https://www.youtube.com/ - I like the layout of youtube home page, the clean rows of videos with just enough space and blank space between them to not seem overly cluttered yet they fit in as many as possible. It has a nice user interface on the side containing links and important action buttons making them easy to find and get to. I really like the layout and design of youtubes website, one thing that could be improved is the ability to scroll through content on the main page, similair to how netflix allows you to scroll left or right in a section without leaving the page youre on.

3) https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/ - I like the way blizzard has the website segmented into rectangle chunks, each chunk features a different chunk of content. Overall i think it is a very clean, well designed website, the one thing i think that could be improved is that the page could have links to the content at the top on the side that would move as you scrolled up or down the page allowing you to access that content without going back to the top of the page.

4)https://www.miniclip.com/games/ - things i dislike about this webpage are the amount of white space on the sides of the page, the location of the drop down menus and no side menu or other access to the dropdowns. To improve the webpage i would reduce the white space, spacing out the content more, possibly enlarging some of it too, and adding in a side menu that would run the whole length of the page to further reduce the white space on the sides.

5)https://www.linnbenton.edu/mylb.php - I think this page is well designed, it makes good use of spacing and colors to distinguish the different sections and draws your attention quickly to the 3 main buttons in the center of the page. something that could improve the page would be further making the sections stand out by creating a frame or box around the sections
