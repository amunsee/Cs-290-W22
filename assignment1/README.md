Web app design

Main page of web app would serve as the jumping off point to many other pages, this would have links and brief information about each of the games, from this page users could jump to the game they wanted to play. 

Each game page would have the game, info about the game rules instructions, high scores etc. From there it would show similair games to go to or the ability to go back to the main page.
