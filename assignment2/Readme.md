Continuing on from assignment 1 design with some changes. Changed from the idea of embedding games into web app to videos as this will make it more easier to implement. Web app will feature a light blue color, using boxs containing individual videos sepearated into similiar content categories. Home page will feature select content in each category while going to the category  page will have the entire catalog of content in that category. Ideally would like to have a pop out player for playing the videos, but may have to settle for opening a tab with the contents original source at this time.
