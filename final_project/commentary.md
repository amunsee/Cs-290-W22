re review of sites for assignment 0:
1. Looking at the milliondollarhomepage i stand by what i originally said its a terrbile website and my opinion has not changed.
2. Youtube I think the layout is simple but thats what makes it look good, any more and it would be to cluttered, until learning about responsive web pages that adapt to the window size I had never noticed/paid attention to web pages adjusting to being resized but after playing with that I think it is an even better website than before.
3. Overall i still think blizzard has a good page, but links to sections of the content below by category would be a nice improvment.
4. Miniclip is simple yet clutted they really try to pack as much into the small sapce as possible, also it doesnt not seem to resize at all they do have it fixed so that nothing gets broken by making the window smaller but thats it, overall its a meh site, they could make better use of the space for the page and just have it scroll down a bit.
5. After playing with the lbcc site more I think it is even better, the responsive adaptations to the nav bar/menu at the top and stacking of content boxs/reorganizing of they layout is really good. Lbcc's website i think is often underrated.

review of my projects:
Well obviously they arent great :P I'd say the aspect I like the least of my previous projects is the layout/design, that's largely due to be new to web development and has gotten better as it went, but I dont think it was very good in the beginning still isn't but better. I feel satisfied with my final project and getting my server side stuff to work but overall am not a fan of my older projects, they served their purpose for learning but I dont want to look at them any more lol.
