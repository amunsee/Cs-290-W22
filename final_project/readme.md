Assignment: create a web application that uses all the things we learned for the term

For the final I build a website that built onto the server created for assignment 5.

Server was created using Node/Express, it is looking for for files in a subfolder from its self name "public". It also requires a json file name words.json to have at least an empty array in it otherwise the server will crash when trying to load in the history for the map search history.

all client end files are stored in public subfolder of this directory, words.json will be in the same level of the directory as the node server.
